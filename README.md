# hanoi_tower_solver
This little program is part of a list of programs created to practice on recursive functions.

The Hanoi tower game is a puzzle game where, given a x number of disks and 3 rods, the goal is to transfer the all stack of disks from a rod to another one, obeying few simple rules.
For a full description of the game, please click on the link below:

The program takes as an input an integer indicating the number of disks to start with. Using a recursive function, the program returns a series of on-screen-instructions on how to solve the puzzle.
The rods are named 'A' (left rod), 'B' (middle rod) and 'C' (right rod).

I hope you find this script useful and please feel free to let me know your opinion and ideas to improve this program.
Cheers.
